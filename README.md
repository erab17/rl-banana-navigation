# Project 1: Navigation

## Introduction
In this project an agent will be trained to collect bananas in a 2d squared world. The agents job is to collect yellow banans and possibly avoid blue banans. The yellow bananas give a +1 reward whereas the blue bananas give a -1 reward.

The agent can take four different actions:
- Move forward.
- Move backward.
- Move left.
- Move right.
